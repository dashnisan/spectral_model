Modeling of short circuit current on irradiance spectral parameters

<h2>CONTEXT</h2>
<p>
  These files show the work performed in years 2006 and 2007 on the analysis of the influence of the spectral variation of solar radiation on the power production of different photovoltaic materials. <br>
  Motivation was then the market appearance of other materials than silicon as power generators; the so-called thin-film technologies. At that time there was a big uncertainty in the market players of the PV branch worldwide, specially in Europe as
  former leader of the "green" power production. There was a need to precisely model the production of solar power plants for delivering forecasts to network operators. At that time it was clear that the physical-chemical properties of many of these 
  thin-film materials was highly unstable under real outdoor conditions.<br><br>
  The master thesis document is presented here along some code for modeling and making forecasts according to those models.
